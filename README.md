# libnut - Some Random Libraries

Libnut is a random collection of my own libraries.
They all have only one in common. All of them are
designed to be very small and simple. Or bether
I tried to make them small and simple as possible.

At the moment there are the following libraries:

* [args - Organize Your Arguments](args/)
* [progress - Multiple Progressbars The Simple Way](progress/)
* [tui - A Curses Alternative](tui/)
